        <h3>Who'd have known</h1>
        <p>It's five o'clock in the morning<br>
            Conversation got boring<br>
            You said <q>you're going to bed soon</q><!--작은인용인라인--><br>
            So I snuck off to your bedroom<br>
            And I thought I'd just wait there<br>
            Til I heard you come up the stairs<br>
            I pretended I was sleeping<br>
            And I was hoping you would creep in<br>
            <strong>With me</strong><!--사실 <b>와 큰차이가 없다--></p>
        <p>You put your arm around my shoulder<br>
            It was as if the room got colder<br>
            We moved closer in together<br>
            And started talking bout the weather<br>
            Said tomorrow would be fun<br>
            We can watch 'A Place In The Sun'<br>
            I didn't know where this was going<br>
            <b>When you kissed me</b></p>
        <P>Are you mine?<br>
            Are you mine?<br>
            Cause I stay here all the time<br>
            Watching telly, drinking wine<br>
            Who'da known, who'da known<br>
            When you flash up on my phone<br>
            I'd no longer feel alone<br>
            No longer feel alone</P>
        <p>I haven't left here for days now<br>
            And I'm becoming amazed how<br>
            You're quite affectionate in public<br>
            In fact, your friend said it made her feel sick<br>
            And even though it's moving forward<br>
            There's just the right amount of awkward<br>
            And today you accidentally<br>
            Called me baby</p>

        <h2>Skinny love</h2>
        <p>Come on, skinny love, just last the year<br>
            Pour a little salt, we were never here<br>
            <em>My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my</em><br>
            Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer</p>
        <p>Tell my love to wreck it all<br>
            Cut out all the ropes and let me fall<br>
            <i>My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my</i><!--사실 <b>와 큰차이가 없다--><br>
            Right at the moment, this order's tall</p>
        <p>And I told you to be patient<br>
            And I told you to be fine<br>
            And I told you to be balanced<br>
            And I told you to be kind</p>
        <p>And in the morning, I'll be with you<br>
            But it will be a different kind<br>
            'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets<br>
            And you'll be owning all the fines</p>
